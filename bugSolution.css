The issue stemmed from incorrect operator precedence and missing spaces. The corrected code ensures proper spacing and order of operations within the `calc()` function.  For example,  instead of `width:calc(100%-10px);`, it should be `width: calc(100% - 10px);` to ensure subtraction happens before the percentage calculation.  Always review the order of operations and unit consistency within `calc()` to prevent such errors.
